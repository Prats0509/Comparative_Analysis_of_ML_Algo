# Comparative Analysis of Machine Learning Algorithms

This project focuses on evaluating and comparing the performance of multiple machine learning algorithms on a given dataset. The analysis includes implementation, training, testing, and evaluation using a variety of metrics.

## Objective
The primary objective is to determine the most effective machine learning algorithm for the given dataset by analyzing their performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Data was loaded and prepared for modeling, including encoding and splitting.
   - Libraries such as `pandas` and `numpy` were used for data manipulation.
   
2. **Algorithms Used**:
   - Logistic Regression
   - Decision Tree Classifier
   - Random Forest Classifier
   - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
   - Gaussian Naive Bayes
   - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
   - Linear Discriminant Analysis
   
3. **Evaluation Metrics**:
   - Accuracy Score
   - F1 Score
   - Precision Score
   - Recall Score
   - ROC-AUC Score
   
4. **Visualization**:
   - ROC curves and other performance plots were generated using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Results
The project includes a comparative analysis of algorithms, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses for different datasets and metrics. [Specific results can be detailed here if available.]
